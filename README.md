# Bluetooth-Jacket
Code for a bluetooth-connected jacket that can pause, play, and change songs

The devices used in this jacket can be purchased through Adafruit. There are projects for conductive
fabric on the website and in the forums. This is an extension of those projects, where buttons are segments of conductive
fabric on the jacket's sleeve, and they are connected via conductive thread to the Adafruit Flora. The Flora is then bluetooth connected with any bluetooth-enabled device and is able to control any song media played on that device.
